# My Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems. I am actively posting my solutions here as I work through problems on different platforms.

## Repository Structure
- Each solution is stored in a structured manner based on the problem category or source.
- The solutions are primarily implemented in **C++**.
- I focus on writing **optimized** and **well-structured** code with explanations where necessary.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository using:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/subhm2004/Leetcode_Solutions/tree/main
  ```
- Navigate to the required solution file and run the C++ program using a compiler like `g++`:
  ```sh
  g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output
  ./output
  ```
